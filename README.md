## Installation

cd client

```
npm install
```
create a DB with the name of learnr
```
open server folder with an IDE of your choice(recommended IntelliJ)
```
Create a folder named "resources" within the main server folder, containing one file named " application.properties" and copy the following information inside that file:
  
  
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/learnr
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL9Dialect
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.enable_lazy_load_no_trans=true
```
Run the server side main application by clicking the run button of your IDE of choice.(that would populate the DB and start the server)

```
Leave the server running 

```
Exit the server folder and cd into the client folder. The npm install should have installed all the necessary files and you can type npm start which would run the application. 
```

If react app is not starting:

```
try npm update
```

If that does not fix it:

```
npm audit fix

```

If that does not fix it:

```
npm audit fix â€”force
```
